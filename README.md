Project Overview

This project is a GitHub User Explorer, a React-based web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and explore details such as repositories, 
followers, and individual repository details. It uses react-router-dom for navigation and leverages GitHub's public API to fetch user data dynamically. 
The project demonstrates key features like component-based architecture, API integration, and route management for an interactive and responsive user experience.
